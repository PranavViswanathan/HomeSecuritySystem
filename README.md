Security of personal belongings is one of the highest priorities of a modern
day person. From personal safes to advanced biometric locking, the amount
of technology that exists to mitigate theft and increase security goes up every
year. According to U.S department of Justice, 3.7 million burglaries occurred
each year on average from 2003 to 2007. The need of a active defence mechanism to deter and subdue possible burglars has increased tremendously

The detection of the intruder will be done using a HC-SR04 Ultrasonic sensor. With additional funding, the utilization of face tracking and identifying
software and hardware can be implemented. After the threat is detected, the
time of the intrusion will be transmitted to the cloud server via MQTT
