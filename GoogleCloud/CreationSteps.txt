# Steps followed to make the Cloud server

On a Google Chrome browser on your computer, go to:
https://console.cloud.google.com/compute
You may have to be logged in to your Google account with your email.
If not, it may prompt you.
There, create a project, if you do not have one already. Give the project any name or, leave it
as default My Project
Then, create an instance by clicking 'Create an Instance'
In the form that opens up,
>> In the Firewall section, check both 'Allow HTTP traffic' and 'Allow HTTPS traffic'
>> Leave everything else as default
>> Then press 'Create' button
This may take a few minutes. If everything is successfull,
it will show a page with the name of the instance.
It will also show its external ip address.
3) Logging in to the cloud server:
Create a rsa key pair to ssh to this server as per the steps below:
If you are using a macbook, or any unix OS, open a terminal and run the
following command:
(If you are using Windows, you can open powershell and run this command.
(Or, you can use putty)
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C <user name>
--- where <user name> may be replaced with your user name
for example,
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C raman
When it prompts for file name to store the keys, you can either use the default,
or use any other file name.
Once completed, this command will generate two files.
They are private and public keys.
These files are saved at the location you entered in when it prompted.
Next, you need to enter the contents of the public key to metadata
of the cloud server as follows:
On the browser, go to .https://console.cloud.google.com/compute
Then, click on metadata
> Click on SSH Keys
> Then click on Add SSH keys
Note: If you have earlier added ssh keys to this server,
> There click on Edit
> Then click on +
> Then, paste the contents of the .pub file here
> Then press Save
Now, you can ssh to your cloud instance with the following command
from a terminal of your computer as follows:
(Microsoft Windows users can do this in a powershell, or use Putty)
ssh -i <absolute path of private key file name> <user name>@<external ip address
of cloud server>
Example:
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa raman@35.232.76.4
where id_rsa is the name of the default private key.
Use the correct file path and file name of your private key as per what you have
chosen when running ssh-keygen command above
Hereafter, to login to the cloud server, use the above command
4) login to the cloud server and set root password
sudo passwd
5) Update server
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
6) check python on your cloud server:
which python3
python3 --version
7) run the following command to install pip3:
sudo apt install python3-pip
which pip3
pip3 --version

8) Some helpful hints about editors
If you are using vim editor, you may do the following (Your choice):
a) Do the following to have mouse right click in vim
echo "set mouse-=a" > ~/.vimrc
Then edit the file ~/.vimrc and add the following line to get colours when editing
syntax on
set hlsearch
b) Do the above for root user as well. You need to su to superuser to do this.
su
echo "set mouse-=a" > /root/.vimrc
Then edit the file /root/.vimrc and add the following line to get colours when editing
syntax on
set hlsearch
